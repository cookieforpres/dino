# Dino

16-Bit virtual machine with working registers and stack.

## Note

Compiler is currently written in Go and very unstable as its just for testing, please wait for an official release, until then the virtual machine is the only thing available.

You can still look at the examples [HERE](https://github.com/cookieforpres/dino/tree/main/examples) to get a look at the syntax, its only in the early stages so it is subject to change in the future.
